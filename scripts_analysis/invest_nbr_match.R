# Re: Match investments to neighborhoods (Census tracts)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Script Description ------------------------------------------------------

# This script matches the geospatial data of SGC investments to 2010 Census
# tract boundaries, and attaches tract IDs to each investment. 

# Inputs:
# Raw investment spatial data
# Lookup tables for investments

# Outputs:
# Investments paired with Census tracts
# Cleaned investment lookup tables

# Update log: 
# 10/6/20 - converted from RMarkdown to R script for faster processing.

# Setup -------------------------------------------------------------------
